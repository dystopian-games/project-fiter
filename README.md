Project Fiter
=============

##### 2D scroller platformer, partially based on [Mario Bros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Bros.). We, as a team, want to create a game together, and learn about the process.
##### The game starts with the objective of touching the end flag, with enemies and powerups along the way, which can be activated or killed by touching or jumping on respectively. The player starts off as a character, trying to avoid dying and defeating the bosses. The player is allowed a range of utilities to assist the left-to-right journey.
